## Project Log
I spend alot of time and energy on learning Vue, and then i realised that i don't practice the new concepts that i'm learning enough.
So i tried to do this challenge with Vue JS, it's a component based landing page for jobs with filtering feature! you can filter jobs and see what suits you. I use animations along side with vue features for that purpose.
The filtering part was a challenge, but i've managed to made that work with help of friends/StackOverFlow.
I also made this landing page responsive, but i need to work on my responsive skills for big screens.

## Note to myself
I have to refactor some of the code inside this project to increase readability.
